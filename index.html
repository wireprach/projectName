					It powers our homes, workplaces, and provides a means for us to access
					easy communication, and convenient access to the internet. This access
					has evolved over time. Power lines have long been the site for

					<h1><a>CAMERAS</a></h1>
						<p>Within the last decade CCTV cameras have become more incresingly
							present in modern society. Commonly seen in private, public and
							industrial settings, cameras have long been used as a means to
							safeguard and protect. However, as of the last couple of years,
							society has come to doubt whether cameras truly protect us, and
							instead put our privacy in jeopardy. This concern has been raised
							due to the internet's ever-growing presence and influence over
							technology, and conspiracy theories that government leaders are
							using the internet and CCTV cameras for surveillance.</p>

						<p>While we may sense and visualize the presence of the internet
							through different networks and forms of technology in front of us,
							it's ability to connect us to the world is made possible through
